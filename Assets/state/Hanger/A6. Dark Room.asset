  storytext: "Right, well, that took far longer than anticipated but the lock is off
    and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud. \r\n\r\nYou're
    in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the top of the combustion boilers.
    You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, \"shut off the valves...\", THUNK THUNK, \"...get
    out in time?\", THUNK THUNK, \"...massive pressure\", THUNK THUNK \"...for glory\"...
    THUNK THUNK...\r\n\r\nWhat next, Adventurer?\r\n\r\n1. Get closer to the people
    speaking.\r\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
